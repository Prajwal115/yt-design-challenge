# figma-design-challenge
Well, this was for the Figma design challenge I had in collaboration with Youtube India.

📌 **Problem Statement**

Design an invisible but discoverable interface that allows users to instantly pick up a video where they left off, on any other device (TV, mobile, laptop), without manual syncing or backend support.

⸻

🎯 **Objective**

To create a smooth, intuitive UI that:
	•	Enables seamless video continuation across devices
	•	Preserves visual and spatial continuity
	•	Uses temporary handoff indicators and state transitions
	•	Requires no backend logic—just interface magic

⸻

🌀 **Concept: “The Wormhole”**

My prototype introduces a “Wormhole”—a dynamic visual portal that:
	•	Appears automatically when another device is detected with YouTube open
	•	Shows a live thumbnail of the current video
	•	Offers ‘Switch Here’ and ‘Dismiss’ actions
	•	Uses a red-and-white circular animation to mimic a portal opening
	•	Is non-intrusive, timed, and auto-dismissable

⸻

🧠 **UX Principles Used**
	•	Active vs Passive Transitions: Prioritizes user control over auto-switching (things mentioned in the Figma file)
	•	Visual Continuity: Keeps user focused with consistent layout and positioning
	•	Discoverability: Portal appears subtly—visible only when relevant
	•	Non-frictional Design: No manual syncing, no navigation required

⸻

🛠️ **Tools Used**
	•	Figma – For UI/UX design and prototyping
	•	Material Design Guidelines – For consistency and platform-native behavior
	•	Roboto Font – Matches YouTube’s interface standards
